        <p>
          The interstage is a composite structure that connects the first and
          second stages, and houses the pneumatic pushers that allow the first
          and second stage to separate during flight. Falcon 9 is equipped with
          four hypersonic grid fins positioned at the base of the interstage.
          They orient the rocket during reentry by moving the center of
          pressure.
