              Falcon 9 is a reusable, two-stage rocket designed and manufactured
              by SpaceX for the reliable and safe transport of people and
              payloads into Earth orbit and beyond. Falcon 9 is the worldâ€™s
              first orbital class reusable rocket. Reusability allows SpaceX to
              refly the most expensive parts of the rocket.
